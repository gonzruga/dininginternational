# Main Milestones
- Initial Setup and Project Skeleton: Set up the basic project structure, including front-end and back-end folders, and initialize the necessary dependencies for React, Node.js, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.

- User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization functionality. Users should be able to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Event organizers should have additional privileges.

- Event Creation and Management: Develop the features necessary for event organizers to create, edit, and delete dining events. This includes defining event details such as date, time, location, menu, and available seats.

- Event Search and Reservation: Implement the functionality for users to search for dining events based on various criteria such as date, location, and cuisine. Users should be able to view event details and make reservations for available seats.

- Communication and Notifications: Integrate a notification system that allows event organizers to communicate with attendees. This can include sending event updates, reminders, and notifications for reservation confirmations or cancellations.

These milestones will help us stay on track and ensure that we have a clear progression plan for the development of the dining event organizer website.
